Steps: 
1. ASP.NET Web Application (.NETFramework - 4.72) 
2. Web API 
3. Use NuGet to add Swashbuckle (5.6.0)
4. Add controllers that I want to do certain things...
5. Test, Test, Test...
6. Refreshments.

This is older MS tech (.NET 4.7) - but in this case I wanted an example for situations where .net Core was not practical. 

To see this implemented go:

or to swagger UI for more options

For the SQL - I chose to use Entity Framework (for SQL) EF.   Am using the older to make it with with .NET 4.7..

Next DB study: a full fledged CRUD using a db, plus authentication (but I will be doing the frontend UI for that first...)
